# Logo Instructions

## Logo File Placement

Please place your logo image file in the `client/public/` directory with the filename `logo.png`.

The logo should be a circular emblem featuring:
- Dark blue outer ring with "ANACONDA-DEER LODGE COUNTY" and "EMERGENCY APP" text
- Central design with a deer head, oil derrick, snake, mountains, trees, and Star of Life
- Dark red and dark green color scheme

## Supported Formats

The logo is referenced as `/logo.png` throughout the application. Supported image formats:
- PNG (recommended for transparency)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG (scalable, but update references to `/logo.svg` if using this format)

## Where the Logo Appears

The logo will automatically appear in:
1. **Public Home Page** - Hero section (large) and navbar (small)
2. **Public Alerts Page** - Navbar
3. **Personnel Login Page** - Above the login form
4. **Personnel Dashboard** - Navbar
5. **Browser Tab** - As the favicon

## File Size Recommendations

- Navbar/icon size: 50x50px (displayed at this size)
- Hero section: 150x150px (displayed at this size)
- Favicon: 32x32px or 64x64px recommended

For best results, use a PNG file with transparency or a square image that works well when displayed at different sizes.
